abstract: This material relies on @Hull. Some mathematical background is skipped to emphasize the data analysis, model logic, discussion, graphical approach and R coding [@Rref]. As in the philosophy of @knuth1984literate, the objective of this document is to explain to human beings what we want a computer to do as literate programming. This is a work in progress and it is under revision.
